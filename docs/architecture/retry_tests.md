# Retry Package Tests Documentation

## Overview

The `pkg/retry/retry_test.go` file contains comprehensive unit tests for the retry package, verifying its functionality across various scenarios. These tests ensure that the retry mechanism correctly handles success cases, different error types, context cancellation, custom configurations, concurrent operations, backoff calculations, and panic situations. The tests use a table-driven approach and mock operations to simulate different retry scenarios without requiring actual API calls.

## Test Functions

### TestRetrySuccess

```go
func TestRetrySuccess(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the basic retry functionality with different scenarios:

1. **Immediate success**: Verifies that operations that succeed immediately return the correct result without retries
2. **Success after retries**: Confirms that operations that initially fail but later succeed are retried correctly
3. **Non-retryable error**: Ensures that non-retryable errors are not retried
4. **Max retries exceeded**: Verifies that the retry mechanism stops after the maximum number of retries

This test ensures that the core retry functionality works as expected in various success and failure scenarios.

### TestRetryWithDifferentErrorTypes

```go
func TestRetryWithDifferentErrorTypes(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the retry behavior with different error types:

1. **Rate limit errors**: Verifies that rate limit errors trigger retries
2. **Timeout errors**: Confirms that timeout errors trigger retries
3. **Unavailable errors**: Ensures that unavailable errors trigger retries
4. **Non-retryable errors**: Verifies that non-retryable errors do not trigger retries
5. **Mixed error types**: Tests handling of different error types in sequence

This test ensures that the retry mechanism correctly identifies which errors should trigger retries based on their type.

### TestRetryWithContextTimeout

```go
func TestRetryWithContextTimeout(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the retry behavior with context cancellation and timeouts:

1. **Context timeout before first retry**: Verifies that the retry mechanism stops if the context times out before the first retry
2. **Context timeout during retries**: Confirms that the retry mechanism stops if the context times out during retries
3. **Operation completes before context timeout**: Ensures that operations complete successfully if they finish before the context times out

This test ensures that the retry mechanism respects context cancellation and timeouts, which is important for preventing long-running operations from continuing unnecessarily.

### TestRetryWithCustomConfig

```go
func TestRetryWithCustomConfig(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the retry behavior with custom configurations:

1. **Fast retries**: Verifies that fast retry configurations result in quick retries
2. **Slow retries**: Confirms that slow retry configurations result in longer waits between retries
3. **High jitter**: Tests that high jitter configurations add significant randomness to backoff times

This test ensures that the retry mechanism correctly applies custom configurations, which is important for adapting the retry behavior to different API characteristics.

### TestConcurrentRetries

```go
func TestConcurrentRetries(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the retry behavior with concurrent operations:

1. **Multiple goroutines**: Runs multiple retry operations concurrently
2. **Independent results**: Verifies that each goroutine gets its own result
3. **Successful completion**: Confirms that all goroutines complete successfully

This test ensures that the retry mechanism is thread-safe and can be used in concurrent environments, which is important for high-throughput applications.

### TestCalculateBackoff

```go
func TestCalculateBackoff(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the backoff calculation function:

1. **Initial attempt**: Verifies the backoff for the first retry
2. **Subsequent attempts**: Confirms that backoff increases exponentially
3. **Maximum backoff**: Ensures that backoff is capped at the maximum value
4. **Jitter**: Tests that jitter adds randomness to backoff times
5. **Different backoff factors**: Verifies that different backoff factors result in different growth rates

This test ensures that the backoff calculation function correctly implements exponential backoff with jitter, which is important for preventing thundering herd problems.

### TestRetryWithPanic

```go
func TestRetryWithPanic(t *testing.T)
```

Tests the retry behavior when the operation panics:

1. **Panic recovery**: Verifies that panics in the operation function are not caught by the retry mechanism
2. **Test recovery**: Uses a defer/recover in the test to catch the panic
3. **Attempt count**: Confirms that only one attempt is made before the panic

This test ensures that the retry mechanism does not suppress panics, which is important for debugging and error reporting.

## Testing Techniques

The file demonstrates several testing techniques:

1. **Table-Driven Tests**: Uses tables of test cases to test multiple scenarios efficiently
2. **Mock Operations**: Uses mock functions to simulate different retry scenarios
3. **Error Checking**: Verifies that errors are correctly identified and handled
4. **Timing Verification**: Checks that backoff times are within expected ranges
5. **Concurrency Testing**: Tests behavior in concurrent environments
6. **Panic Handling**: Verifies behavior when operations panic

## Test Coverage

The tests cover the following aspects of the retry package:

1. **Success Scenarios**: Tests that successful operations return the correct result
2. **Error Handling**: Verifies that different error types are handled correctly
3. **Context Integration**: Tests that context cancellation and timeouts are respected
4. **Configuration Options**: Verifies that custom configurations are applied correctly
5. **Concurrency**: Tests behavior in concurrent environments
6. **Backoff Calculation**: Verifies that backoff times are calculated correctly
7. **Panic Handling**: Tests behavior when operations panic

## Dependencies

- `context`: For creating contexts for tests
- `errors`: For creating and checking errors
- `fmt`: For formatting strings and errors
- `sync`: For synchronizing concurrent tests
- `testing`: Standard Go testing package
- `time`: For timing operations and setting timeouts
- `github.com/amorin24/llmproxy/pkg/errors`: For creating model-specific errors

## Integration with the Retry Package

These tests verify the functionality of the retry package, ensuring that:

1. The retry mechanism correctly implements the retry logic
2. The backoff calculation function correctly implements exponential backoff with jitter
3. The retry mechanism correctly integrates with the context package
4. The retry mechanism correctly identifies which errors should trigger retries

## Usage

Run these tests using the Go test command:

```bash
go test -v github.com/amorin24/llmproxy/pkg/retry
```

These tests are also run as part of the continuous integration process to ensure that changes to the retry package implementation do not break existing functionality.

## Best Practices Demonstrated

The tests demonstrate several best practices for testing Go code:

1. **Table-Driven Tests**: Using tables of test cases to test multiple scenarios efficiently
2. **Isolated Tests**: Each test function focuses on a specific aspect of the retry package
3. **Clear Test Names**: Test names clearly indicate what is being tested
4. **Expected vs. Actual**: Tests clearly compare expected and actual results
5. **Error Messages**: Error messages include both expected and actual values
6. **Timing Verification**: Tests verify timing behavior within reasonable ranges
7. **Concurrency Testing**: Tests verify behavior in concurrent environments
8. **Panic Handling**: Tests verify behavior when operations panic

These best practices ensure that the tests are comprehensive, maintainable, and provide clear feedback when failures occur.
